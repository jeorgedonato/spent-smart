## Motivation

A very crucial skill in life that is rarely taught in school, is how to budget your income and spending appropriately.  As a result, many adults, especially young adults, will encounter difficult situations such as falling into debt and having to make financial sacrifices.  With our easy-to-use Spent Smart application, you can view your financial situation in a snapshot to help guide you into making smart spending decisions according to your available income and savings.


## Project Description

Initially, users will be prompted to sign-up or log-in to the application.  Spent Smart allows users to input their monthly income and expense breakdown (along with their associated category options, such as paycheck, food, transportation, etc.).  The goal is to be net positive after accounting for all of the users' expenses, which will result in a savings amount.  Graphs of the users' data can be found under the Reports section.

Pages of this application include:

  * Log-in Page
  * Sign-up Page
  * E-mail Confirmation Page
  * User Dashboard
  * View + Add/Update/Delete Expenses
  * View + Add/Update/Delete Income
  * Graph Reports
